																		<p>Pay scale in this field is very high, but the pay scale varies for a botanist in the private and government sector. The pay scale depends on the factors such as qualification, designation, experience and skills of an individual. Those who want to start their career as a teacher or researcher can expect a salary ranging from Rs18, 000 to Rs.20, 000 per month. For those working in other sectors can initially earn a salary in between Rs.15, 000 to Rs. 25,000 per month and the salary might reach up to Rs.80, 000 per month depending on the above factors.</p>

Biotechnology course material can be classified into two sections- theory section and practical section. In theory section, students will have to deal with subjects related to biology as well as basic technology concepts.</p>
														<p>Practical section is also very important. Students will have to spend good amount of time in laboratory, performing practical lessons as well as lab training. </p>

																	</h4>
																</div>
																<div id="collapse-3" className="panel-collapse collapse">
																	<div className="panel-body">
																		<p>The major advantage of doing a B.Sc. course in this subject is that the course duration is short, when compared to a B.E./B.Tech. Program. B.Sc. course takes 3 years to complete. Whereas B.E./B.Tech. Program takes 4 years.</p>
																		<p>Another advantage is the relatively low saturation level in this field. From facts and figures, it is quite evident that B.Sc. Biotechnology is not a very popular professional course among 12th Science students. Students prefer courses like B.E./B.Tech., MBBS, BDS etc. On seeing the ‘B.Sc.’ label, they tend to ignore Biotechnology course. This has resulted in relatively less number of takers for this course. Ultimately, this has resulted in low job market saturation too! So, it is safe to say that finding a good job after graduation won’t be a tough task, when compared to heavily saturated courses!</p>
																		<p>Then comes the attractive prospect of availability of lucrative scholarships. Many State Governments are offering all studies expense covering scholarships to meritorious students, who choose to pursue B.Sc. course. Such scholarships are provided to students scoring above 85% merit marks only.</p>
																		<p>Biotechnology is a rapidly developing sector. Advancements are being made at good pace in this sector. Big firms are pouring in big money into it and new business opportunities are developing in this sector. These things have led to huge increase in job openings in this sector. In short, Biotechnology graduates are in huge demand these days.</p>
